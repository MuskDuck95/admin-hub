# Admin Hub

Admin Hub is a lightweight, fully customisable, frontend-only website designed to serve as a dashboard for system administrators.

It aims to be the home page of system administrators who want to see the health of each site in their environment and want quick access to other admin portals and tools.

Admin Hub only needs a few megabytes of space on a web server in your environment (e.g. Apache or IIS).

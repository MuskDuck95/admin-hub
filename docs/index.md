# Admin Hub

Admin Hub is a lightweight, fully customisable, frontend-only website that’s designed to serve as a dashboard for system administrators.

It lets sysadmins see the health of each site in their environment and quickly access admin portals and tools.

Admin Hub only needs a few megabytes of space on a web server in your environment to run (e.g. on an Apache or IIS server).
